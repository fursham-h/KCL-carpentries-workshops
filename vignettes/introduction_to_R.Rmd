## Lesson pre-requisites
Please ensure you have the latest version of R and RStudio installed on your 
machine. This is important, as some packages used in the workshop may not 
install correctly (or at all) if R is not up to date.  

You may refer to this [link](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/#preparations)
for an easy-to-follow tutorial on how to install these softwares on your computer.  
**Note: Please skip the section on `Install required R packages` for this workshop.**
